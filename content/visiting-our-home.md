Welcome to our home! We've listed some useful information for you while you visit.

## House rules

- Please close doors to the outside quickly. Don't leave them open - we have cats and they could escape.
- Our cats are friendly but are shy. Please don't chase after them if they run away from you.
- Avoid going upstairs, that's the safe space for our cats if they get stressed.

## Wifi

We have one band for wifi in the house, listed below.

## Basement

### Television

Feel free to use the television in the basement. Please note that the Samsung TV remote can be unresponsive so we have an NVIDIA Shield to use for streaming services, listening to music, etc. We also have a SNES Classic system setup that can be used to play some SNES games. A Steam Link is also setup but that requires a connection to a computer running Steam.

Each device is labeled on the source list on the TV. When you're done using the TV, please return the TV to the NVIDIA Shield source.

Currently, we have HBO, Netflix, and our local Plex server for guests to enjoy. Please use a guest account when using any of these services.

#### Remotes

We have an NVIDIA Shield remote (left) and a Samsung TV remote (right).

The Samsung TV remote can be used to turn on the TV display, change input sources, and adjust TV volume.

Use the NVIDIA Shield remote to turn on the Shield and choose what to watch on the Shield. It can also be used to adjust the TV volume.

We recommend using the NVIDIA Shield remote as much as possible - the Samsung TV remote can be unresponsive at times.

#### Troubleshooting

##### Sound

If the sound isn't working on the TV, try turning off and on _just_ the NVIDIA Shield via the remote. **Keep the TV display on during this process.**

##### Unresponsive remote

The remote can sometimes be unresponsive.

Make sure you point the remote to the IR receiver for the TV (bottom right of the TV). We've found pressing the buttons firmly can help register them better.

Also, the pointer feature of the remote responds much better than pressing the arrow buttons - to use it, place your finger on the pointer button and use motion controls to point to selections on the screen.
