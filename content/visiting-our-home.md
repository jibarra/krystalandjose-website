Welcome to our home! We've listed some useful information for you while you visit.

## House rules

- Please close doors to the outside quickly. Don't leave them open - we have cats and they could escape.
- Our cats are friendly but are shy. Please don't chase after them if they run away from you.
- Avoid going upstairs, that's the safe space for our cats if they get stressed.

## Basement

### Television

Feel free to use the television in the basement. Please note that the Samsung TV remote can be unresponsive so we have an NVIDIA Shield to use for streaming services, listening to music, etc. We also have a SNES Classic system setup that can be used to play some SNES games.

The NVIDIA Shield is on HDMI input 4 and the SNES Classic is on HDMI input 3. When you're done using the TV, please return the TV to the NVIDIA Shield (HDMI input 4).

Currently, we have HBO, Disney Plus, Hulu, and our local Plex server for guests to enjoy. Please use a guest account when using any of these services. We've saved all available services as apps to the Shield home page.

#### Remotes

We hae an NVIDIA Shield remote (left) and a Samsung TV remote (right).

The Samsung TV remote can be used to turn on the TV display, change input sources, and adjust TV volume.

Use the NVIDIA Shield remote to turn on the Shield and choose what to watch on the Shield. It can also be used to adjust the TV volume.

We recommend using the NVIDIA Shield remote as much as possible - the Samsung TV remote can be unresponsive at times.

#### Troubleshooting

If the sound isn't working on the TV, try turning off and on _just_ the NVIDIA Shield via the remote. **Keep the TV display on during this process.**
