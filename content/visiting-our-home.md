# Basement

## Television

Feel free to use the television in the basement. Please don't change the settings or inputs on the TV. If you do, please set it back to the original settings.

We have Netflix, HBO, our local Plex server, and other services for guests to enjoy. Please use a guest account when using any of these services. We've saved all available services as apps to the Shield home page.

### Remotes

We hae an NVIDIA Shield remote (left) and a Samsung TV remote (right). Use the Samsung TV remote to turn on the TV display and use the NVIDIA Shield remote to turn on the Shield, adjust TV volume, and choose what to watch.

### Troubleshooting

If the sound isn't working on the TV, try turning off and on _just_ the NVIDIA Shield via the remote. **Keep the TV display on during this process.**
